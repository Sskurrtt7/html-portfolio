<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>Hello! I’m Kurt Joshua T. Tardecilla, a passionate Web Developer based in Rodriguez, Rizal, Philippines. 
  I specialize in fullstack development, and I thrive on creating impactful and innovative solutions that 
  make a difference.</p>

<p>With a background in Information Technology, I have honed my skills in front-end and backend development. 
  My approach blends creativity, technical expertise, and a commitment to delivering results.
  I’m driven by a love for coding and designing, and I believe in the power of collaboration 
  to turn ideas into reality. Whether it's crafting user-friendly interfaces, 
  building robust applications, or telling stories through visuals, I always aim to leave a lasting impression.</p>

<p>When I’m not working, you can find me running for fun and good health, playing video games,
  playing basketball, hiking, bonding with friends either in a public place or getting a good cup of coffee with them
  watching series or movies, constantly seeking inspiration from the world around me.</p>
